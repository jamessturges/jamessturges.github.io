# Welcome!
Hi, I’m James Sturges! I’m a solutions architect specializing in enterprise data management and large-scale IT transformation projects. I’ve worked with organizations of all sizes—Fortune 500 companies, state government agencies, and even small family-owned businesses. Wherever you are in your data journey, I’ll help you get to production smoothly and efficiently.

I’m also a lifelong learner, always looking to expand my skills and perspectives. Lately, I’ve been diving into Python and learning Japanese. When I’m not saving the day with seamless integrations, you’ll find me building web apps and APIs for fun. Curious? Check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/jamessturges) to see what I’ve been working on!
